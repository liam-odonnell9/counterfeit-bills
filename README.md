# counterfeit-bills
In this project, I used Kaggle to find a dataset on bill dimensions (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexandrepetit881234/fake-bills). The goal of this project was to build a model to determine if a bill is counterfeit or genuine.

As you will see in the attached notebooks, several models were explored including Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Sequential Modeling with TensorFlow.
